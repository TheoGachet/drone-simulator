# Bio-Robotic Fly Vision Simulation

### Project Description
In collaboration with Ines Grellat-Sevilla, I worked on a project focused on mimicking drone vision and behavior using a bio-robot. We created an environment where the robot navigated between walls with gray-striped patterns of varying shades. By implementing Gaussian sensitivity functions and utilizing MATLAB and Simulink, we successfully simulated the photoreceptors' response to different shades of gray.

### Overview
This project aims to simulate the vision and behavior of flies through the development of a bio-robot. By leveraging biomimicry principles and advanced computational tools, we replicate the patterns and movements observed in flies. The simulation focuses on the interaction between the photoreceptors of the fly's eye and its perceived environment. Through the use of Gaussian sensitivity functions and precise calibration, we accurately replicate the photoreceptors' response to different shades of gray. This project demonstrates the potential of biomimetic approaches in robotics and provides insights into the complex visual systems of insects.
